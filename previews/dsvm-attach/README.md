# DSVM Attach to AML Workspace (Preview)

## Overview
Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) is unmanaged machine learning workstation. DSVM is recomended for individual data scientists that need a friction-free, pre-configured data science environment since it comes pre-configured and up-to-date ML packages, deep learning frameworks and GPU drivers.

This PREVIEW will provide a delightful DSVM attach to Azure ML so that existing DSVM users can get value-add features and an easier on-ramp to Azure ML.

![benefit](./media/b2.svg) <strong>SSO Applications (e.g.Â Jupyter)</strong>

![benefit](./media/b3.svg) Automatic upgrades of VM Environment (sw/
packages)

![benefit](./media/b4.svg) Mounted hosted AML Datastores

![benefit](./media/b5.svg) <strong>Ease of access to resource from AML</strong>

Interactive job is supported on **AMLArc Compute** and will be available on AmlCompute and Compute Instances in a future release.

## Prerequisites
- Azure ML Workspace -  - if you don't have any please find simple instruction [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/quickstart-create-resources#create-the-workspace)
- Azure Data Science VM (DSVM) based on Ubuntu (*)- if you don't have any please find simple instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/dsvm-ubuntu-intro)

> Note (*): at this point only Ubuntu based DSVM are supported. Currently only Ubuntu 18.04 is supported.

> Note (INTERNAL): Currently only `centraluseaup` region is supported.

## Get started
### [prereq] Configure DSVM firewal
This step is needed since the Azure ML service needs to have access to the DSVM (for accessing Jupyter noteboks)

1. Go to your DSVM in  [Azure Portal](https://porta.azure.com)

1. Go to Firewall settings and allow inbound connection to service tag `AzureMachineLearning` and for ports `23000-30000` (see below) 

|Parameter|Value|
|------|-----|
|Source|Service Tag|
|Source service tag| AzureMachineLearning|
|Source port ranges| * (any)|
|Destination| Any|
|Service|Custom|
|Destination port ranges| 23000-30000|
|Protocol|Any|
|Action|Allow|
|Priority| something low enough to apply, e.g. 1001|
|Name| name your rule, e.g. AzureML|

### Attach your DSVM to AML Workspace
Now you have everything prepared and can attach your DSVM:

1. Go to [AML Portal](https://ml.azure.com) and select your workspace

1. Select Compute and then Attached Compute ![select-compute](./media/attach-01-select-compute.png)

1. Create new (attched compute - the following screen may vary whether you have already attached compute before) ![create-new](./media/attach-02-create-new.png)

1. Name your compute (this name appears in AML Studio) and select your DSVM from your Subscription (dropdown list) and hist "Attach" button (this operation can tak minute or two) ![select-dsvm](./media/attach-03-attach-step.png)

1. After a while you should see your DSVM to be succesfully attached and also can access your application (Jupyter) via link on the compute row ![access-jupyter](./media/attach-05-jupyter.png)

You can now work using Jupyter with SSO - try [this tutorial](./docs/attach-dsvm-and-run-simple-notebook.md).
